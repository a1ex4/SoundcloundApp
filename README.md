# Soundclound App
Download your liked tracks or track from a user, with tags

## Usage

* Login with your Soundcloud email and username (you need to be logged even for a user)
* Choose which songs you want to downloade
* Edit title/artist : some special charaters (such as " | ", "Ãª") will crash the app due to Windows restriction in naming files. If you have a problem downloading a song, it's probably from the name, if it's too long for example.
